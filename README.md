### Project Setup

There is no backend for this project, it's a simple client side rendered app built using [Vue](https://vuejs.org).

To start developing on the project,

1. Clone the repository
2. Inside the project director, run `npm install`
3. Then run `npm run serve`, the development server will be running on `http://localhost:8080`

### Contributing

The list of all developers is a huge JSON array (I know!), it's located at `public/developers.json`

Just add all quality developer blogs you read to the JSON array, and create a pull request.

Also, please don't add your own blog. I will shamelessly close that PR no matter who you are.

I have a blog, and it's not part of this list because I write shit content.
